# Hey, Iâ€™m Bryn! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught developer honing my skills through hands-on projects from freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.

## What Iâ€™m About
- **Skills**: HTML, CSS, Git
- **Learning**: Currently diving deeper into developing a Landing Page as a project to improve my skills in responsive design, modern CSS techniques, and user experience optimization.
- **Goal**: Building clean, efficient code that solves real problems.

## My Work
- **[freeCodeCamp Projects](https://github.com/bryn24k/freeCodeCamp)**: A collection of challenges like calculators and portfolio pages. Check out my [Live Demo](https://bryn24k.github.io/freeCodeCamp/1.%20Responsive%20Web%20Design/Survey%20Form/) for the Developer Survey project!
- **[The Odin Project](https://github.com/bryn24k/The-Odin-Project)**: Full-stack-ish adventuresâ€”think interactive UIs and more. See my favorite: [Odin Recipes](https://bryn24k.github.io/The-Odin-Project/Foundations/Odin%20Recipes/index.html).
- **Pinned Below**: Scroll down for my top repos!

Thanks for stopping byâ€”letâ€™s build something cool together!
